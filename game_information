Each player who owns a settlement adjacent to a terrain hex marked with the number rolled receives a resource produced by this hex. Hills produce brick, forests produce lumber, mountains produce ore, fields produce grain, and pastures produce wool. \n We use these resources to expand across Catan: we build roads and new settlements, or we upgrade our existing settlements to cities. For example, a road costs 1 brick and 1 lumber. If we do not have the necessary resources, we can acquire them by trading with our opponents. \n Each settlement is worth 1 victory point and each city is worth 2 victory points.

Our challenge to designer Matt Leacock was to create a game that would contain familiar elements (cooperative play, modular board), while offering up a completely different in-game experience.

To celebrate this milestone, Pandemic has been completely re-designed.

Two new characters (the Contingency Planner and the Quarantine Specialist) face the game in ways you never thought possible as brand-new, virulent challenges await you!  In Pandemic , several virulent diseases have broken out simultaneously all over the world! The players are disease-fighting specialists whose mission is to treat disease hotspots while researching cures for each of four plagues before they get out of hand.  The game board depicts several major population centers on Earth. On each turn, a player can use up to four actions to travel between cities, treat infected populaces, discover a cure, or build a research station. A deck of cards provides the players with these abilities, but sprinkled throughout this deck are Epidemic! cards that accelerate and intensify the diseases' activity. A second, separate deck of cards controls the \"normal\" spread of the infections.  Taking a unique role within the team, players must plan their strategy to mesh with their specialists' strengths in order to conquer the diseases. For example, the Operations Expert can build research stations which are needed to find cures for the diseases and which allow for greater mobility between cities; the Scientist needs only four cards of a particular disease to cure it instead of the normal five\u2014but the diseases are spreading quickly and time is running out.

You will be the leader of a group of critters intent on just such a task. There are buildings to construct, lively characters to meet, events to host - you have a busy year ahead of yourself. Will the sun shine brightest on your city before the winter moon rises? Everdell is a game of dynamic tableau building and worker placement. On their turn a player can take one of three actions: a) Place a Worker: Each player has a collection of Worker pieces. These are placed on the board locations, events, and on Destination cards. Workers perform various actions to further the development of a player's tableau: gathering resources, drawing cards, and taking other special actions. b) Play a Card: Each player is building and populating a city; a tableau of up to 15 Construction and Critter cards. There are five types of cards: Travelers, Production, Destination, Governance, and Prosperity. Cards generate resources (twigs, resin, pebbles, and berries), grant abilities, and ultimately score points. The interactions of the cards reveal numerous strategies and a near infinite variety of working cities. c) Prepare for the next Season: Workers are returned to the players supply and new workers are added. The game is played from Winter through to the onset of the following winter, at which point the player with the city with the most points wins.", "youtube_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1b9zQz7COxs", "original_price": 2216, "discount_price": 1662, "images": ["//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0589/6618/0046/products/71QvSEpVrxL._AC_SL1098_1024x1024.jpg?v=1645628926", "//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0589/6618/0046/products/1_1024x1024.png?v=1645629127", "//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0589/6618/0046/products/a88239e3fcbb3bc347e21c7f34468860_original_1024x1024.png?v=1645629158", "//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0589/6618/0046/products/Screen_Shot_2020-07-05_at_11.27.26_AM_1024x1024.png?v=1645629185", "//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0589/6618/0046/products/b7f5e12f9b93fd6c1a02910a86c6a4ef_original_1024x1024.png?v=1645629198", "//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0589/6618/0046/products/d32fd110f18e0783cc151e4f9ad4d036_original_1024x1024.png?v=1645629209", "//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0589/6618/0046/products/def22e6c1b5ce23faea6def3deaad096_original_1024x1024.png?v=1645629219", "//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0589/6618/0046/products/71jqwWFknVS._AC_SL1500_1024x1024.jpg?v=1645629231"], "is_in_stock": true, "language": "English", "SEO_EN": "everdell", "SEO_AR": "EVERDELL"}, {"game": "Catan - 5 & 6 Player [AR/EN]", "url": "https://crocodice.net/products/catan-5-6-player-extension", "description": "*Very Important: This edition is only compatible with Catan published by (Kosmos or Superheated neurons) make sure you have these publisher logo on the back of your Catan box\nNow five to six players can explore and settle Catan!

They run the household and they have the last word at home in the tents. Different families are divided into tribes, headed by the \u2018Imascheren\u2019 (or nobles). As leader of a Tuareg tribe, players trade goods from near (such as dates and salt) and far (like pepper), in order to obtain gold and other benefits, and enlarge their family. In each round their new offerings are made. Cards are a means to an end, in order to obtain the popular tribe cards.Gameplay:The board consists of a 5x5 grid: a border of 16 squares with printed action symbols and then 9 blank squares in the centre onto which cards are dealt. Meeples are placed one at a time on the spaces at the edges of the board (not including corner squares). You cannot place a meeple on a square the opponent has a meeple on already, nor on a square facing opponent's meeple. Once all meeples are placed, players then execute the actions on the border squares the meeples are on and also take the cards from the centre that match the row and column of the border meeples.The game is predominantly scored and won by playing tribal cards to your display. These give advantages during the game and victory points at the end. Usually cards are played (or discarded) immediately once drawn.

Ragnarok has come, and it's the end of the world! It's the Vikings' last chance to go down in a blaze of glory and secure their place in Valhalla at Odin's side! For a Viking there are many pathways to glory. You can invade and pillage the land for its rewards, crush your opponents in epic battles, fulfil quests, increase your clan's stats, or even die gloriously either in battle or from Ragnarok, the ultimate inescapable doom. Most player strategies are guided by the cards drafted at the beginning of each of the three game rounds (or Ages). These \"Gods' Gifts\" grant you numerous boons for your clan including: increased Viking strength and devious battle strategies, upgrades to your clan, or even the aid of legendary creatures from Norse mythology. They may also include various quests, from dominating specific provinces, to having lots of your Vikings sent to Valhalla. Most of these cards are aligned with one of the Norse gods, hinting at the kind of strategy they support. For example, Thor gives more glory for victory in battle, Heimdall grants you foresight and surprises, Tyr strengthens you in battle, while the trickster Loki actually rewards you for losing battles, or punishes the winner. Players must choose their strategies carefully during the draft phase, but also be ready to adapt and react to their opponents' strategies as the action phase unfolds. Battles are decided not only by the strength of the figures involved, but also by cards played in secret. By observing your opponents' actions and allegiances to specific gods, you may predict what card they are likely to play, and plan accordingly. Winning battles is not always the best course of action, as the right card can get you even more rewards by being crushed.

The center of the known galaxy and seat of the former Lazax Empire. Scarred by the flames of betrayal, Rex is a specter of a fallen empire and of ages long forgotten, yet it remains an object of reverence and desire in a galaxy of conflict and uncertainty. Once, the great city that spanned its surface was the pinnacle of civilization. Today, Mecatol City is naught but a blasted shell of its former glory, a grim respite in the toxic Sea of Desolation that covers the majority of the planet. Even so, its parabolic history of decadence and destruction does little to deter those who would seek to harness its power. The Winaaran custodians who dwell within the remnants of the city maintain what is left of the former capital, waiting for one of the Great Races to step forward and take up the mantle of the former Emperors. But who among the races of the galaxy could fill the void left by the Lazax? To lay claim to the throne is a destiny sought by many, yet the shadows of the past serve as a grim warning to those who would follow in their footsteps... \nTwilight Imperium: Fourth Edition is a game of galactic conquest in which three to six players take on the role of one of seventeen factions vying for galactic domination through military might, political maneuvering, and economic bargaining. Every faction offers a completely different play experience, from the wormhole-hopping Ghosts of Creuss to the Emirates of Hacan, masters of trade and economics. These seventeen races are offered many paths to victory, but only one may sit upon the throne of Mecatol Rex as the new masters of the galaxy. \nNo two games of Twilight Imperium are ever identical. At the start of each galactic age, the game board is uniquely and strategically constructed using 51 galaxy tiles that feature everything from lush new planets and supernovas to asteroid fields and gravity rifts. Players are dealt a hand of these tiles and take turns creating the galaxy around Mecatol Rex, the capital planet seated in the center of the board. An ion storm may block your race from progressing through the galaxy while a fortuitously placed gravity rift may protect you from your closest foes. The galaxy is yours to both craft and dominate. \nA round of Twilight Imperium begins with players selecting one of eight strategy cards that both determine player order and give their owner a unique strategic action for that round. These may do anything from providing additional command tokens to allowing a player to control trade throughout the galaxy. After these roles are selected, players take turns moving their fleets from system to system, claiming new planets for their empire, and engaging in warfare and trade with other factions. At the end of a turn, players gather in a grand council to pass new laws and agendas, shaking up the game in unpredictable ways. \nAfter every player has passed their turn, players move up the victory track by checking to see whether they have completed any objectives throughout the turn and scoring them. Objectives are determined by setting up ten public objective cards at the start of each game, then gradually revealing them with every round. Every player also chooses between two random secret objectives at the start of the game, providing victory points achievable only by the holder of that objective. These objectives can be anything from researching new technologies to taking your neighbor's home system. At the end of every turn, a player can claim one public objective and one secret objective. As play continues, more of these objectives are revealed and more secret objectives are dealt out, giving players dynamically changing goals throughout the game. Play continues until a player reaches ten victory points.", "youtube_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLybps39ZwM", "original_price": 5126, "discount_price": 3845, "images": ["//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0589/6618/0046/products/twilight-imperium-fourth-edition-board-game-canada_1024x1024.jpg?v=1628252247", "//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0589/6618/0046/products/91WYu-wfs4L._AC_SL1500_1024x1024.jpg?v=1644576744", "//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0589/6618/0046/products/71VmcOopW_L._AC_SL1500_1024x1024.jpg?v=1644576756", "//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0589/6618/0046/products/51VSTvsHboL._AC_1024x1024.jpg?v=1644576767", "//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0589/6618/0046/products/61eTHYvbEcL._AC_1024x1024.jpg?v=1644576777", "//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0589/6618/0046/products/91mWAC0qEAL._AC_SL1500_1024x1024.jpg?v=1644576787", "//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0589/6618/0046/products/81VArUJvxLL._AC_SL1500_1024x1024.jpg?v=1644576799"], "is_in_stock": true, "language": "English", "SEO_EN": "twilight-imperium-(4th-ed.)", "SEO_AR": "TWILIGHT-IMPERIUM-(4TH-ED.)"}, {"game": "Tiny Towns", "url": "https://crocodice.net/products/tiny-towns", "description": "You are the mayor of a tiny town in the forest in which the smaller creatures of the woods have created a civilization hidden away from predators.

Each title consists of three chapters, each taking about 75 minutes to play. Nothing is destroyed, so the games can be played multiple times.\nIn\u00a0The Dungeon, the players awaken in a prison cell in the middle ages with no memory of how they got there. What happened? What strange things are taking place in this dungeon? And most importantly, how can they get out?

You and your fellow medical graduates have been called up to the CIA for the critical mission of investigating and preventing its development. Travel the world using carefully constructed aliases to move swiftly between Allied, Neutral, and Soviet cities. Your missions will require you to eliminate Soviet operatives, acquire specific targets, and set up other CIA agents on location to execute your operations without a hitch. As you complete objectives over the course of twelve months, each success or failure will bring you closer to the truth. Combatting this dangerous new pathogen is of utmost importance, but it's not the only threat you'll encounter in the field. Soviet agents are taking root in all parts of the world, and it's critical to your mission that you keep them contained before they can escalate international tensions. Luckily for you, you won't be without backup. Coordinate with other covert CIA operatives for assistance - they're particularly effective at making Soviet spies disappear...quietly. Make strategic use of CIA teams at different locations to clean up the board and keep your eye on your main objectives. Designed as a prequel, Pandemic Legacy: Season 0 does not require you to have completed Season 1 and Season 2 before diving into this Cold War spy thriller. As in the first two Pandemic Legacy games, each time you play brings new cards, rules, and conditions that affect future games. Each alias you create will gain contacts and other assets to execute your plans more smoothly. And, of course, the CIA will be watching and evaluating your performance in the field.

It established and destroyed empires, compelled men to explore the far corners of the earth, and led to the discovery of new worlds. At that time, the value of spices even rivaled that of gold! In the old days, they carried a sense of mystery and allure. Spice merchants would weave fantastic tales of danger to reach these spices in hopes of selling their wares at higher prices. In later centuries, the demand on spices became so great, that those who controlled the spices generated immense wealth and renown. It is at this time, you find yourself leading your caravan across the eastern lands to the Mediterranean Sea in search of wealth and fortune. As a caravan leader, your journey begins on the Spice Road. This is Century: Spice Road!  In  Century: Spice Road , players aim to collect and trade spices in order to acquire point cards and coins that are worth points at the end of the game. Players play cards from their hands to acquire spices for their caravan and trade those spices in for wealth and power (point cards and money), or to purchase new merchant cards to more efficiently acquire rare and valuable spices. Players take one action a turn until someone has acquired their fifth (or sixth in 2-3 player game) point card, players will finish out the current round of play and the person with the most points wins!   Play or Acquire Cards  At the start of the game, each player is given two merchant cards to start with and some preliminary spices. On their turn, each player may choose, as their action for the turn, to play a card from their hand, or spend spices to acquire a new merchant card from the row and place it in their hand. Merchant cards allow players to acquire new spices, exchange spices they currently have for different ones, or upgrade a spice to one worth more. Building up a good spice trading engine of merchant cards is an important part of succeeding on the Spice Road, so look out for powerful play sequences when taking new cards!   Rest  Once they've played all the cards from their hands, players must use their turn action to rest and return their cards to their hand. Now they'll be able to play their cards again on future turns, building up their caravan and further developing their hand of merchant cards to start acquiring point cards.   Claim Point Cards  The way to win in Century: Spice Road is to have the most points at the end of the game. Players get points when they acquire Point Cards and Coins by trading in their spices. Each point card in the row will have a different cost and overall point value listed on it, and the spice cost must be paid to acquire that card. If the two leftmost cards in the row are acquired, whoever acquired one of those point cards can take a coin from the pile above it. Silver coins are worth 1 point at the end of the game and gold coins are worth 3 points! Once a player has bought their fifth point card, the round of play finishes and a winner is crowned!", "youtube_link": "None", "original_price": 1384, "discount_price": 1134, "images": [], "is_in_stock": true, "language": "English", "SEO_EN": "century:-spice-road", "SEO_AR": "CENTURY:-SPICE-ROAD"}, {"game": "Agricola", "url": "https://crocodice.net/products/agricola", "description": "In Agricola (Latin for \"farmer\"), you're a farmer in a wooden shack with your spouse and little else.

You might think about having kids in order to get more work accomplished, but first you need to expand your house. And what are you going to feed all the little rugrats?  Agricola is a turn-based game. There are 14 game turns plus 6 harvest phases (after turn 4, 7, 9, 11, 13, and 14). Each player starts with two playing tokens (farmer and wife) and thus can take two actions per turn. There are multiple options, and while the game progresses, you'll have more and more: first thing in a turn, a new action card is flipped over. Problem: Each action can be taken just once per turn, so it's important to do some things with high preference. Each player also starts with a hand of 7 Occupation cards (of more than 160 total) and 7 Minor Improvement cards (of more than 140 total) that he may use during the game if they fit in his/her strategy.

But the true hope of the Free Peoples lies with the quest of the Ringbearer: while the armies clash across Middle Earth, the Fellowship of the Ring is trying to get secretly to Mount Doom to destroy the One Ring. Sauron is not aware of the real intention of his enemies but is looking across Middle Earth for the precious Ring, so that the Fellowship is going to face numerous dangers, represented by the rules of The Hunt for the Ring. But the Companions can spur the Free Peoples to the fight against Sauron, so the Free People player must balance the need to protect the Ringbearer from harm, against the attempt to raise a proper defense against the armies of the Shadow, so that they do not overrun Middle Earth before the Ringbearer completes his quest.\nEach game turn revolves around the roll of Action Dice: each die corresponds to an action that a player can do during a turn. Depending on the face rolled on each die, different actions are possible (moving armies, characters, recruiting troops, advancing a Political Track).\nAction Dice can also be used to draw or play Event Cards.

The killer is one of the investigators! Each player's role and team are randomly assigned at the start of play and include the unique roles of Forensic Scientist, Witness, Investigator, Murderer, and Accomplice. While the Investigators attempt to deduce the truth, the murderer's team must deceive and mislead. This is a battle of wits!The Forensic Scientist has the solution but can express the clues only using special scene tiles while the investigators (and the murderer) attempt to interpret the evidence. In order to succeed, the investigators must not only deduce the truth from the clues of the Forensic Scientist, they must also see through the misdirection being injected into the equation by the Murderer and Accomplice!Find out who among you can cut through deception to find the truth and who is capable of getting away with murder!Roles:- Forensic Scientist x1As the game master, the Forensic Scientist holds the solution to the crime. They are responsible for assisting the Investigators in identifying the \u201cKey Evidence\u201d and \u201cMeans of Murder.\u201d When an Investigator does that successfully, the crime is solved and the Forensic Scientist and the Investigators win the game.During the game, the Forensic Scientist is NOT allowed to hint to the solution with words, gestures, or eyes.- Murderer x1When the crime takes place, the Murderer chooses 1 Clue card and 1 Means card as the solution to the crime. These will be the \u201cKey Evidence\u201d and \u201cMeans of Murder\u201d respectively.The Murderer tries to hide their role and look for a scapegoat. Even if they are identified, the Murderer still wins the game if no one correctly identifies both the \u201cKey Evidence\u201d and the \u201cMeans of Murder\u201d.- Investigators x8To solve the crime, the Investigators must analyze the hints given by the Forensic Scientist. As long as one of the Investigators correctly identifies both the \u201cKey Evidence\u201d and \u201cMeans of Murder,\u201d the Murderer is arrested and the Investigators win the game (as does the Forensic Scientist).Bear in mind that the Murderer (and sometimes Accomplice) is among the Investigators! The innocent Investigators must make a vigorous effort to defend themselves from false accusation.- Accomplice x1The Accomplice is an optional role for games with six or more players. The Accomplice knows who the Murderer is, as well as the solution to the crime. The Accomplice and Murderer both win if the Murderer gets away with his crime.- Witness x1The Witness is an optional role when playing with six or more players.* The Witness is an Investigator who has witnessed the culprits leaving the crime scene. They have no way of knowing which is the Murderer and which is the Accomplice and they do not know how the crime was committed.If the Murderer is arrested but can identify the Witness, the Witness is considered to be killed, allowing the Murderer and the Accomplice to get away with murder and win the game.", "youtube_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wQn-WNSb3Jw", "original_price": 1110, "discount_price": 910, "images": ["//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0589/6618/0046/products/hththt_1024x1024.png?v=1653580802", "//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0589/6618/0046/products/gfgfg_1024x1024.png?v=1653580844"], "is_in_stock": true, "language": "English/Arabic", "SEO_EN": "deception:-murder-in-hong-kong", "SEO_AR": "DECEPTION:-MURDER-IN-HONG-KONG"}, {"game": "Quixo", "url": "https://crocodice.net/products/quixo", "description": "Quixo bears a superficial resemblance to Tic-Tac-Toe \u2013 with one player being crosses and the other circles, and with both trying to create a line of their symbol \u2013 but that's where the resemblance ends.

Actions located \"later\" on the gears are more valuable, so it's wise to let the time work for you \u2013 but players cannot skip their turn; if they have all their workers on the gears, they have to pick some up.\u00a0\nThe game ends after one full revolution of the central Tzolkin gear.

Over the course of two thousand years, the temple complex was gradually expanded and became widely known as \"The Most Select of Places\" ( Ipet-Isut ), boasting the largest religious building in the world. Today, the site is known as Karnak, located at Luxor in modern-day Egypt.\nJoin ancient Pharaohs in creating and growing one of the most impressive sites the world has seen, honoring the Egyptian gods Horus, Ra, Hathor, Bastet, Thoth, and Osiris. You must carefully manage the balance of your actions, preparing for the reckoning by the goddess Maat.\nThe game board in Tekhenu: Obelisk of the Sun is divided into six sections, each associated with an Egyptian god: Horus, Ra, Hathor, Bastet, Thoth, and Osiris. In the center stands an impressive obelisk ( Tekhenu ) that casts its shadow onto different parts of the board. As a result, the area around the obelisk is divided into sunny, shaded, and dark sections, depending on how the obelisk casts its shadow at that particular moment. As the game progresses, the sun's rotation alters which sections are sunny, shaded, or dark.\nThe game takes place over multiple rounds, following this pattern: 2 Rounds =\u00a01 Rotation 2 Rotations\u00a0=\u00a01 Maat phase 2 Maat phases =\u00a01 Scoring 2 Scorings =\u00a01 Game \nEach round, you draft dice and perform actions associated with the value of the die and the section from which the die was drafted. At the beginning of the game, each of the six sections contains three dice. However, as dice are drafted and eventually refilled, the different sections will contain a varying number of dice.  Dice come in five colors: white, yellow, black, brown, and gray. Depending on the color of the die and the position of the obelisk's shadow, each die is considered Pure, Tainted, or Forbidden. While you may never draft Forbidden dice, you are free to draft any other die, whether Pure or Tainted.\nWhen drafting a die, you must consider not only the general availability of dice \u2014 if no dice are available in a given section, then you cannot readily perform the action associated with that section \u2014 but also which value die to draft and how your chosen die will affect the overall balance when the Maat phase occurs. An imbalance in favor of Purity carries no negative outcome whereas a Tainted imbalance may result in the loss of victory points. A perfect balance between Pure and Tainted dice, however, results in more favorable turn order.  After drafting one die and placing it on your player board (either on the Pure or Tainted side), you perform an action, the effect of which depends on the value of the die you selected.\nHorus Taking the Horus god action allows the building of statues, either in honor of one of the gods or for the people. Building a statue in honor of a god grants you benefits when other players perform actions associated with that god. Building a statue for the people grants favorable benefits during scoring.  Ra When taking the Ra god action, you add a pillar to the Amun-Ra temple grid, scoring victory points and gaining resources and possibly powerful bonus actions.  Hathor The Hathor god action results in the construction of buildings around the Amun-Ra temple complex, providing rich resources and considerable influence during scoring. This action also increases the current population.\nBastet By taking the Bastet god action, a festival takes place, increasing the happiness of the people. However, the happiness marker can never overtake the population marker, making it necessary to strike a balance between different actions. Keeping your people happy unlocks powerful one-time benefits as well as bonus victory points during scoring and more options when taking the Thoth god action.  Thoth The game includes three types of cards: blessings, technologies, and decrees. Taking the Thoth god action allows you to gain these cards, the type of which is determined by the happiness of your people. Also, the happier your people are, the greater the selection of cards available from which you can choose.  Osiris Taking the Osiris god action allows you to construct workshops and quarries, each of which increases your production of one of the four resources: papyrus, bread, limestone, and granite. During scoring, you are rewarded for having the most workshops or quarries of each type.\nProduction Instead of these six god actions, you can choose to produce, generating resources based on the color of the die (yellow = papyrus, brown = bread, white = limestone, and black = granite) and the current production value of that resource.  Scoring During each scoring, you have rewarded victory points: For having the most workshops or quarries of each type.  For buildings constructed near the Amun-Ra temple complex.  Based on the number of statues you have constructed.  Based on the happiness of your people.  For having constructed a large number of buildings (whether near the temple complex or as workshops or quarries).  For achieving maximum production. However, you must also keep a healthy amount of resources around to sustain your population, or else you suffer negative consequences.

Which roles will you play in the new world? Will you own the most prosperous plantations? Will you build the most valuable buildings? You have but one goal: achieve the greatest prosperity and highest respect! This is shown by the player who earns the most victory points. He will win the game!    In Puerto Rico, players assume the roles of colonial governors on the island of Puerto Rico. The aim of the game is to amass victory points by shipping goods to Europe or by constructing buildings.  Each player uses a separate small board with spaces for city buildings, plantations, and resources. Shared between the players are three ships, a trading house, and a supply of resources and doubloons. \nThe resource cycle of the game is that players grow crops which they exchange for points or doubloons. Doubloons can then be used to buy buildings, which allow players to produce more crops or give them other abilities. Buildings and plantations do not work unless they are manned by colonists. \nDuring each round, players take turns selecting a role card from those on the table (such as \"Trader\" or \"Builder\"). When a role is chosen, every player gets to take the action appropriate to that role. The player that selected the role also receives a small privilege for doing so - for example, choosing the \"Builder\" role allows all players to construct a building, but the player who chose the role may do so at a discount on that turn. Unused roles gain a doubloon bonus at the end of each turn, so the next player who chooses that role gets to keep any doubloon bonus associated with it. This encourages players to make use of all the roles throughout a typical course of a game.  Puerto Rico uses a variable phase order mechanism in which a \"governor\" token is passed clockwise to the next player at the conclusion of a turn. The player with the token begins the round by choosing a role and taking the first action. \nPlayers earn victory points for owning buildings, for shipping goods, and for manned \"large buildings.\" Each player's accumulated shipping chips are kept face down and come in denominations of one or five. This prevents other players from being able to determine the exact score of another player. Goods and doubloons are placed in clear view of other players and the totals of each can always be requested by a player. As the game enters its later stages, the unknown quantity of shipping tokens and their denominations require players to consider their options before choosing a role that can end the game. \nIn 2011 and mostly afterward, Puerto Rico was published to include both Puerto Rico: Expansion I \u2013 New Buildings and Puerto Rico: Expansion II \u2013 The Nobles. These versions are included in the other game entry Puerto Rico (with two expansions), not this regular game entry for Puerto Rico.

Theme Enter a vast, underwater cosmos: a mysteriously interconnected world of sharp teeth, glowing eyes, and black ink, where your survival depends on your ability to adapt to the unknown. The foundation of the oceanic food chain is billions of one-celled organisms called phytoplankton that capture the sun's energy through photosynthesis. The next level is species that feast on the sea's abundant plant life \u2014 zooplankton. All of this takes place in Catherine Hamilton's beautifully illustrated central board called the Reef. Every other oceanic species is a predator, each bigger than the next, all the way up to the dreaded apex predator. And even bigger than apex predators are enormous filter feeders that gently swim through the ocean scooping up everything in their path with their baleen.  Gameplay Oceans is a continuation of North Star's quest to make a gamers' game that is easy to teach. Game designers Nick Bentley and Dominic Crapuchettes don't think people need to sit through 30+ minutes of rules explanations to get an immersive experience.  The foundation of Oceans is a simple turn structure and a deck of 10 straightforward traits, making it easy to learn all of the cards and wade effortlessly into the first game. The 10 traits were chosen because of the rich thematic interconnections, providing a tapestry of synergistic card play. Additionally, there are 4 randomly chosen scenario cards that activate (and sometimes deactivate) at various points during the game. The scenario cards impact the basic tenets of gameplay, encouraging people to vary their play style and strategy each game.  This foundation loosely mimics a scientific oceanic ecosystem, similar to what you've come to expect from games in the Evolution series. This is the core of Oceans and it's fully playable on its own. But there's more if you are willing to dive a bit deeper...  Oceans also includes something which will break the seams of the scientific reality you've come to accept: The Deep. The Deep is a deck of 100 unique power cards that require an additional cost to play. These power cards range from things you might find in nature to the fantastical Kraken or Leviathan.  Oceans is an engine builder where the world of science is disrupted at the seams by the world of fantasy. Players must adapt to the changing environment with an interconnected ecosystem that can survive and thrive against the inevitable march of time and the natural struggle of predators seeking to survive.", "youtube_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5KA3O58u50", "original_price": 1708, "discount_price": 1285, "images": ["//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0589/6618/0046/products/91suqjYg97S._AC_SL1500_1024x1024.jpg?v=1645358479", "//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0589/6618/0046/products/81Af0wiowJS._AC_SL1500_1024x1024.jpg?v=1645359286", "//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0589/6618/0046/products/cbf896d6a958e3dbec947ed34c75fd8e_original_1024x1024.gif?v=1645359286", "//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0589/6618/0046/products/gameplay-render-1500_1_1024x1024_09ede9fe-47b7-4f05-9198-800e93155fd4_1024x1024.jpg?v=1645359286", "//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0589/6618/0046/products/6b6078fef0c7a3cae2ce8744c36e8ef5_original_1024x1024.jpg?v=1645359286", "//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0589/6618/0046/products/71sRNj_aqCL._AC_SL1275_1024x1024.jpg?v=1645359286", "//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0589/6618/0046/products/61HWh57rWJL._AC_SL1275_1024x1024.jpg?v=1645359282", "//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0589/6618/0046/products/61J0vrac32L._AC_SL1275_1024x1024.jpg?v=1645359282", "//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0589/6618/0046/products/3ea9d1186ddeccf6a0c041c055d98c74_original_1024x1024.jpg?v=1645359266"], "is_in_stock": true, "language": "English", "SEO_EN": "oceans", "SEO_AR": "OCEANS"}, {"game": "Munchkin: Rick & Morty", "url": "https://crocodice.net/products/munchkin-rick-morty", "description": "Munchkin: Rick And Morty fuses the classic card game fun of monster-slaying and role-playing with cyborgs, aliens, and demons from the popular television series, Rick And Morty.

Instead of winning by competing with other players like most games, everyone must work together to win the game. Players take turns moving their pawns around the 'island', which is built by arranging the many beautifully screen-printed tiles before play begins. As the game progresses, more and more island tiles sink, becoming unavailable, and the pace increases. Players use strategies to keep the island from sinking, while trying to collect treasures and items. As the water level rises, it gets more difficult- sacrifices must be made.\nWhat causes this game to truly stand out among co-op and competitive games alike is the extreme detail that has been paid to the physical components of the game. It comes in a sturdy and organized tin of good shelf storage size. The plastic treasure pieces and wooden pawns are well crafted and they fit just right into the box. The cards are durable, well printed, and easy to understand. The island tiles are the real gem: they are screen-printed with vibrant colors, each with a unique and pleasing image.\nWith multiple levels of difficulty, different characters to choose from (each with a special ability of their own), many optional island formats and game variations available, Forbidden Island has huge replay value. The game can be played by as few as two players and up to four (though it can accommodate five). More players translates into a faster and more difficult game, though the extra help can make all the difference. This is a fun game, tricky for players of almost any age. Selling for under twenty dollars, oddly, Forbidden Island is a rare game of both quality and affordable price.\nFor those who enjoy Forbidden Island, a follow-up project by Gamewright titled Forbidden Desert was released in 2013.\nFrom the publisher's website:\nDare to discover Forbidden Island! Join a team of fearless adventurers on a do-or-die mission to capture four sacred treasures from the ruins of this perilous paradise. Your team will have to work together and make some pulse-pounding maneuvers, as the island will sink beneath every step!

A key card gives you 9 words to give clues and 3 words your partner must avoid. A clue is only one word, but it can point to multiple words that you want your partner to guess. Your partner also gives you clues for the words you need to find. If you both find all the words before you run out of turns, you both win!\nWith a new way to play, 400 new words that work with the original Codenames, and 100 new challenges, Codenames: Duet is sure to push your mind to the limit! Go Undercover! In Codenames: Duet, players must work together to uncover all the secret agents on both sides of the key card before they run out of turns. You'll need to be quick-witted because these challenges will put your deductive skills to the test! It Takes Two to Tango! You and a partner will pick a key card and set up the grid of words.\nYou'll take turns, going back and forth, giving each other clues to guess as many words as possible before passing to the other player. On their turn, a player gives a word and a number as their clue and the other player makes guesses as to which words hide a hidden operative. Correct guesses are covered in a green agent card, if a player guesses a word that is black on your key card, the game is over and you lose. If a guessed word is tan on the key card, that is an innocent bystander and the turn ends with you taking a token from the time bank and placing it on the guessed word. If the two players can guess all 15 hidden operatives before running out of turn tokens, they win the game! Sudden Death If players run out of time, they enter sudden death, relying on previous clues to guess where the remaining operative is hiding. If a word is guessed correctly, the guessing continues, but if a bystander or assassin is uncovered, the game is over and the players lose.\nMore Ways to Play! Codenames: Duet is designed for two players, but it can be played with a group. Players will split up into two teams and play the game as normal, any member of a team able to give the clue. Teams may privately discuss their clues to come up with the perfect one! \nPlayers may also embark on a campaign using the Mission Map pad. Each completed game will let you move on to new and more challenging missions that change the number of turn counters and bystander tokens.

In Citadels Classic, the same inspired and simple gameplay remains, with players attempting to build a fantastical medieval city by constructing different districts. Each round, starting with whoever holds the crown, players will pass around a hand of characters equal to one plus the number of players, secretly choosing one character to employ, taking advantage of their special ability. Among the eight characters you might find, each boasts a different special ability: the Thief can steal all the gold from another player, the King grants gold for each Noble district you have constructed and receives the crown for the next round, and the Architect allows a player to build several districts that turn.   After all players have chosen their character, they are revealed in the order determined by their rank, which is the number printed in the upper lefthand corner of their card. For example, if a player chose the Assassin with its rank of 1, they would resolve their turn first. The next to follow is the Thief with its rank of 2, then the Magician at 3, and so on, skipping characters that were not employed this round, and until all players have resolved their actions.  When you do resolve your turn, you will choose to either take two gold coins from the bank or draw new district cards. Then, if you can afford to pay its cost, you may construct a single district from you hand. You may also resolve your character abilities as they apply during your turn, whether it be naming a character to kill with the Assassin or gaining extra gold with the Trader. Play continues until all players have resolved their actions, then the character cards are reshuffled and a new round begins.  The first player to construct seven districts triggers the endgame, allowing the round to finish and all other players to take their final actions. Each district is worth its cost in victory points, with bonus points awarded for those who construct all seven of their districts and those who have at least one type of each district (noble, religious, trade, military, and unique).

Trying to conclude something while drawing is not as easy as you think! Everyone will try to draw what the game master wrote on the prompt cards, but each player is only allowed to draw one line. For example, if the topic is \"cat\", you could draw an ear or a whisker so that the other players know you know the topic. There is one fake artist among the players - someone who doesn't know the topic and will have to draw a line randomly. After each player has drawn twice, they will have to decide who the fake artist is. If the fake artist receives the most votes, that player loses. Otherwise, the fake artist and the game master win the game. Now, you might think it is extremely easy to find out who the fake artist is, but there is one more rule: Even if the fake artist receives the most votes, that player can still guess the topic of the picture everyone drew - and win with a correct guess! Knowing this rule, it becomes much more difficult for the real artists to draw their lines. You want to show the other artists that you know the topic of the picture, but you don't want to be too obvious in front of the fake artist - so the picture becomes a crazy mess!

Each round, players take turns according to the turn order track, receiving two actions to perform any of the following actions (found in the original game):  1)\u00a0 Build \u00a0- Pay required resources and place an industry tile. 2)\u00a0 Network - Add a rail/canal link, expanding your network. 3)\u00a0 Develop \u00a0- Increase the VP value of an industry. 4)\u00a0 Sell \u00a0- Sell your cotton, manufactured goods and pottery. 5)\u00a0 Loan \u00a0- Take a \u00a330 loan and reduce your income.  Brass: Birmingham \u00a0also features a new sixth action:  6)\u00a0 Scout \u00a0- Discard three cards and take a wild location and wild industry card. (This action replaces Double Action Build in original\u00a0 Brass .)  The game is played over two halves: the canal era (years 1770-1830) and the rail era (years 1830-1870). To win the game, score the most VPs. VPs are counted at the end of each half for the canals, rails and established (flipped) industry tiles.  Birmingham \u00a0features dynamic scoring canals/rails. Instead of each flipped industry tile giving a static 1 VP to all connected canals and rails, many industries give 0 or even 2 VPs. This provides players with the opportunity to score much higher value canals in the first era, and creates interesting strategy with industry placement.  Iron, coal, and cotton are three industries which appear in both the original\u00a0 Brass \u00a0as well as in\u00a0 Brass: Birmingham .  New \"Sell\" system  Brewing has become a fundamental part of the culture in Birmingham. You must now sell your product through traders located around the edges of the board. Each of these traders is looking for a specific type of good each game. To sell cotton, pottery, or manufactured goods to these traders, you must also \"grease the wheels of industry\" by consuming beer. For example, a level 1 cotton mill requires one beer to flip. As an incentive to sell early, the first player to sell to a trader receives free beer.  Birmingham \u00a0features three all-new industry types:  Brewery \u00a0- Produces precious beer barrels required to sell goods.  Manufactured goods \u00a0- Function like cotton, but features eight levels. Each level of manufactured goods provides unique rewards, rather than just escalating in VPs, making it a more versatile (yet potentially more difficult) path vs cotton.  Pottery \u00a0- These behemoths of Birmingham offer huge VPs, but at a huge cost and need to plan.  Increased Coal and Iron Market size \u00a0- The price of coal and iron can now go up to \u00a38 per cube, and it's not uncommon.  Brass: Birmingham \u00a0is a sequel to Brass. It offers a very different story arc and experience from its predecessor.", "youtube_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3efv2HkjDI", "original_price": 2286, "discount_price": "None", "images": [], "is_in_stock": false, "language": "English", "SEO_EN": "brass:-birmingham", "SEO_AR": "BRASS:-BIRMINGHAM"}, {"game": "7 Wonders: Duel - Pantheon", "url": "https://crocodice.net/products/7-wonders-duel-pantheon", "description": "Enki!

After completing the Palaces of Evora and Sintra, the king sought to build a summer pavilion to honor the most famous members of the royal family. This construction was intended for the most talented artisans \u2014 whose skills meet the splendor that the royal family deserves. Sadly, King Manuel I died before construction ever began.In Azul: Summer Pavilion, players return to Portugal to accomplish the task that never began. As a master artisan, you must use the finest materials to create the summer pavilion while carefully avoiding wasting supplies. Only the best will rise to the challenge to honor the Portuguese royal family.Azul: Summer Pavilion lasts six rounds, and in each round players draft tiles, then place them on their individual player board to score points. Each of the six colors of tiles is wild during one of the rounds.At the start of each round, draw tiles at random from the bag to refill each of the five, seven, or nine factories with four tiles each. Draw tiles as needed to refill the ten supply spaces on the central scoring board. Players then take turns drafting tiles. You can choose to take all of the tiles of a non-wild color on a factory and place them next to your board; if any wild tiles are on this factory, you must take one of them. Place all remaining tiles in the center of the table. Alternatively, you can take all tiles of a non-wild color from the center of play; you must also take one wild tile, if present.After all tiles have been claimed, players then take turns placing tiles on their individual boards. Each board depicts seven stars that would be composed of six tiles; each space on a star shows a number from 1-6, and six of the stars are for tiles of a single color while the seventh will be composed of one tile of each color. To place a tile on the blue 5, for example, you must discard five blue or wild tiles from next to your player board (with at least one blue being required), placing one blue tile in the blue 5 space and the rest in the discard tower. You score 1 point for this tile and 1 point for each tile within this star connected to the newly placed tile.If you completely surround a pillar, statue, or window on your game board with tiles, you get an immediate bonus, taking 1-3 tiles from the central supply spaces and placing them next to your board. At the end of the round, you can carry over at most four tiles to the next round; discard any others, losing 1 point for each such tile.After six rounds, you score a bonus for each of the seven stars that you've filled completely. Additionally, you score a bonus for having covered all seven spaces of value 1, 2, 3 or 4. You lose 1 point for each remaining tile unused, then whoever has the most points wins.", "youtube_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHhumQKIa98", "original_price": 1280, "discount_price": 1049, "images": ["//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0589/6618/0046/products/dfdfdf_1024x1024.png?v=1653527497", "//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0589/6618/0046/products/erteer_1024x1024.png?v=1653527497"], "is_in_stock": false, "language": "English/Arabic", "SEO_EN": "azul:-summer-pavilion", "SEO_AR": "AZUL:-SUMMER-PAVILION"}, {"game": "The Resistance (3rd Ed.) - The Plot Thickens", "url": "https://crocodice.net/products/the-resistance-the-plot-thickens", "description": "The Resistance: The Plot Thickens is an exciting expansion to Resistance.It includes the Plot Cards module from the second edition of The Resistance, plus the Rogue, and Sergeant modules originally released as promos.\nIt also includes a full set of replacement Character and Mission cards and new Mission tracking tokens.", "youtube_link": "None", "original_price": 400, "discount_price": "None", "images": ["//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0589/6618/0046/products/81eX-rfHHrL._AC_SL1500_1024x1024.jpg?v=1653509098", "//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0589/6618/0046/products/81BwE09or4L._AC_SL1500_1024x1024.jpg?v=1653509098"], "is_in_stock": false, "language": "English", "SEO_EN": "the-resistance-(3rd-ed.)---the-plot-thickens", "SEO_AR": "THE-RESISTANCE-(3RD-ED.)---THE-PLOT-THICKENS"}, {"game": "Dixit - Vol 07: Memories", "url": "https://crocodice.net/products/dixit-vol-07-memories", "description": "- THIS IS A DIXIT BOARD GAME EXPANSION: You will need the Dixit base game in order to play with this expansion.- STORYTELLING GAME: In Dixit Memories, players enter a realm of exotic landscapes and creatures and discover a fantastic universe where wonderful and ordinary things combine marvelously together.

Each month will bring new surprises, and your actions in each game will have repercussions on the next. Will you let cities fall to the diseases? Will your team be enough to keep the viruses at bay for a whole year? Craft your own unique Pandemic experience with Pandemic Legacy.  Pandemic Legacy is a cooperative campaign game, with an overarching story arc played through 12-24 sessions, depending on how well your group does at the game. In the beginning, the game starts very similar to basic Pandemic, in which your team of disease-fighting specialists races against the clock to travel around the world, treating disease hotspots while researching cures for each of four plagues before they get out of hand.  During a player's turn, they have four actions available, with which they may travel around in the world in various ways (sometimes needing to discard a card), build structures like research stations, treat diseases (removing one cube from the board; if all cubes of a color have been removed, the disease has been eradicated), trade cards with other players, or find a cure for a disease (requiring five cards of the same color to be discarded while at a research station). Each player has a unique role with special abilities to help them at these actions.  After a player has taken their actions, they draw two cards. These cards can include epidemic cards, which will place new disease cubes on the board, and can lead to an outbreak, spreading disease cubes even further. Outbreaks additionally increase the panic level of a city, making that city more expensive to travel to.  Each month in the game, you have two chances to achieve that month's objectives. If you succeed, you win and immediately move on to the next month. If you fail, you have a second chance, with more funding for beneficial event cards.  During the campaign, new rules and components will be introduced. These will sometimes require you to permanently alter the components of the game; this includes writing on cards, ripping up cards, and placing permanent stickers on components.

The rest of the provinces are not affected. After a player attempts to pillage a province containing a god figure, whether he succeeds in the pillaging or not, he must then move the god to a different unpillaged province that does not contain a god figure. So the two gods can never occupy the same province, and they never go to a pillaged or destroyed province.\nAt the beginning of the 2nd and 3rd Ages, the two gods are again placed in random provinces, determined by drawing 2 unused Ragnar\u00f6k tokens.\nThe combination of the two gods used in each game creates a unique texture to that session. They affect draft choices and influence the flow of the battles. Will you try to benefit from a god's power again and again by moving him where you want and always pillaging his province? Or will you do your best to neutralize him by pillaging around his province? Perhaps you'll want to attempt a hopeless pillage on his province just to move him onto another province where he will hinder another player's plans.

There are two paths to victory: closing the portal or slaying all the goblins. Which one will you choose? Either way, your quests will be aided by the help of the surviving, and sacred, mushroom folk - and by the epic items that have been lost in the realm's deep dungeons. The world is ending quickly, so you must act fast to save it, but you also need to know when your luck will run out...  In Tiny Epic Quest, players embark on a sandbox adventure nostalgic of old Nintendo games like The Legend of Zelda and Final Fantasy. Each player controls a band of three elf heroes questing to save the world and the sacred mushroom folk from the intruding goblins.   Each round is broken into two phases: day and night. During the day, players travel far and wide, visiting villages to acquire quests, monuments to learn powerful spells, mushroom groves to seek guidance, and treacherous locations in search of artifacts! Acquiring artifacts empower the heroes with unique abilities; this may improve a heroes' movement or combat, or their ability to learn spells or mitigate harmful dice rolls.  Heroes must travel by foot, by horse, by raft, by boat, and by gryphon to get to all the places they need to go to satisfy their quests - or to position themselves for what night brings. Each type of movement is different, and limited, players need to take careful consideration when traveling, and how they travel, if they wish to accomplish all of their goals.  During the night, players must face the challenges of their quests, and decisions, by rolling dice, hoping for fortune, and knowing when to quit. Will you press on?

Each side of the die (6 sided) represents a different type of action: Movement, Colony Action, Harvest from Culture Planets, Harvest from Energy Planets, Improve an Economic Influence, Improve a Diplomatic Influence.  After the roll, the player then sorts the results of the roll (one selective re-roll is allowed) and organizes the dice in a desired activation order.

After a few minutes, gunfire and hurrying footsteps on the roof can be heard. Heavily armed bandits have come to rob honest citizens of their wallets and jewels. Will they succeed in stealing the suitcase holding the Nice Valley Coal Company's weekly pay, despite it having been placed under the supervision of Marshal Samuel Ford? Will these bandits hinder one another more than the Marshal since only the richest one of them can come out on top?  In Colt Express , you play a bandit robbing a train at the same time as other bandits, and your goal is to become the richest outlaw of the Old West. The game consists of five rounds, and each round has two phases:   Phase 1: Schemin' Each player plays 2-5 action cards on a common pile, with the cards being face up or face down depending on the type of the round. Instead of playing a card, a player can draw three cards from her deck.  Phase 2: Stealin' The action cards are carried out in the order they were played, with a player's best laid plans possibly not panning out due to mistakes and oversights!   The game takes place in a 3D train in which the bandits can move from one car to another, run on the roof, punch the other bandits, shoot them, rob the passengers, or draw the Marshal out of position. The train has as many cars as the number of players, and each car is seeded with gems, bags of loot or suitcases at the start of play.  Each player starts a round with six cards in hand, with each card showing one of these actions. At the start of a round, a round card is revealed, showing how many cards will be played; whether they'll be played face up or face down, or individually or in pairs; and what action will occur at the end of the round (e.g., all bandits on top of the train move to the engine). You can pick up loot, gems or suitcases only by playing a \"steal\" card when you're in a train car that holds one of these items \u2014 but since everyone is planning to get these goods, you'll need to move, punch and shoot to get others out of your way. You can punch someone only in the same car as you, and when you do, the other bandit drops one of the goods he's collected and is knocked into an adjacent car.  Each player's character has a special power, such as starting the round with an extra card, playing your first card face down, or pocketing a bag of loot when you punch someone instead of letting it hit the ground.  You can shoot someone in an adjacent car or (if you're running on top of the train) anyone in sight, and when you do, you give that player one of your six bullet cards; that card gets shuffled in the opponent's deck, possibly giving her a dead card in hand on a future turn and forcing her to draw instead of playing something. If the Marshal ends up in the same car as you, likely due to other bandits luring him through the train, he'll be happy to give you a bullet, too.  At the end of the game, whoever fired the most bullets receives a $1,000 braggart bonus, and whoever bagged the richest haul wins!

Players can jump in and out for individual sessions, but they\u2019ll have the most fun if they player all the sessions in a chapter. Each chapter can be played in a single evening. At the end of the 16 game session campaign, the Diary will be a record of exactly what happened in your village, and who was ultimately responsible for what it became over time.

When any player has six or fewer tokens in their supply, each player takes two more turns, then the game ends. At that point, if they've created a continuous path between the two cities on a ticket, then they score the points on that ticket; if not, then they lose points instead. \n  Ticket to Ride: Rails & Sails  puts a few twists on the  TtR  formula, starting with split card decks of trains and ships (with all of the wild cards going in the train deck). Three cards of each type are revealed at the start of the game, and when you draw cards, you replace them with a card from whichever deck you like. (Shuffle the card types separately to form new decks when needed.) \n Similarly, players choose their own mix of train and ship tokens at the start of the game. To claim a train route (rectangular spaces), you must play train cards (or wilds) and cover those spaces with train tokens, and to claim a ship route (oval spaces), you must play ship cards (or wilds) and cover those spaces with ship tokens. Ship cards depict one or two ships on them, and when you play a double-ship card, you can cover one or two ship spaces. You can take an action during play to swap train tokens for ships (or vice versa), and you lose one point for each token you swap. \n Some tickets show tour routes with multiple cities instead of simply two cities. If you build a network that matches the tour exactly, you score more points than if you simply include all of those cities in your network. \n Each player also starts the game with three harbors. If you have built a route to a port city, you can take an action during the game to place a harbor in that city (with a limit of one harbor per port). To place the harbor, you must discard two train cards and two ship cards of the same color, all of which must bear the harbor symbol (an anchor). At the end of the game, you lose four points for each harbor not placed, and you gain 10-40 points for each placed harbor depending on how many of your completed tickets show that port city. \n  Ticket to Ride: Rails & Sails  includes a double-sided game board, with one side showing the world and the other side showing the Great Lakes of North America.

The fate of all existence is at stake. Is destruction inevitable, or are there ways to avoid ultimate cataclysm? The Norns, mystical beings of great power, have decided they will not go quietly into oblivion and have turned their attention to the well of Fate, Ur\u00f0r, in order to find any possible way to stop Ragnar\u00f6k. Looking deep into the swirling waters, they can foresee which potential combination of heroes, villains, battles, victories, and defeats might stop the end of all that is known \u2014 but will they find the right combination in time? Is there any true path to salvation at all? They must hurry and seek the true way through, before all is lost. \n In   God of War: The Card Game  , players take on the role of the Norns as they try different combinations of heroes and events in order to stop Ragnar\u00f6k. Each game is a new attempt to find the right key to saving Midgard from destruction. Players must work together, embodying mighty heroes such as Kratos, Mimir, Atreus, Brok and Sindri, and Freya. They will fight enemies and bosses from the popular  God of War  video game, but combined and remixed in exciting new ways, creating unique \"What if...?\" scenarios each time they play. If they succeed, the way forward has been secured and Ragnar\u00f6k can be halted. Failure means the Norns will have to try again as only death and destruction lay along that particular path. \n Each quest in  God of War: The Card Game  is made up of a mosaic of cards that recreate monsters and locations from the video game. Each quest's mosaic is different, and each card is double-sided, depending on whether a section has been destroyed or not, and each has special rules that go into effect when it is face up on the tabletop. Learning how each quest is won, as well as what strategy to employ, is key to victory. \n As players progress, earlier quests have an effect on what comes after them. At certain points along their path, players must choose which quest they will complete. Completing one might grant a bonus, but quests left untouched result in dire permanent consequences as the players move forward. These choices and challenges lead to new strategies, making it so no two games of  God of War: The Card Game  are alike. \n Heroes in the game have several elements that make them unique. Each comes with their own dashboard that explains their special abilities and health totals, in addition to tracking the number of cards a player can keep in their hand from round to round. Tokens are used to keep everything clear as heroes gain and lose health and build up their power so they can unleash a mighty special attack. Heroes begin the game with a unique starting deck of cards that will be augmented from additional decks as the game progresses. Players can construct their deck to focus on their strengths or look for ways to generalize their approach, preparing for future quests that lie ahead. Each hero also has a unique standee that indicates which portion of the mosaic they are facing. With multiple heroes from which to choose, numerous ways to build their deck, and various different quests to attempt, each game of  God of War: The Card Game  will be a new experience that will echo throughout eternity. \n \u2014 description from the publisher", "youtube_link": "None", "original_price": 1384, "discount_price": "None", "images": [], "is_in_stock": false, "language": "English", "SEO_EN": "god-of-war:-the-card-game", "SEO_AR": "GOD-OF-WAR:-THE-CARD-GAME"}, {"game": "Ghost Blitz Spooky Doo", "url": "https://crocodice.net/products/ghost-blitz-spooky-doo", "description": "", "youtube_link": "None", "original_price": 691, "discount_price": "None", "images": [], "is_in_stock": false, "language": "English", "SEO_EN": "ghost-blitz-spooky-doo", "SEO_AR": "GHOST-BLITZ-SPOOKY-DOO"}, {"game": "Game of Thrones: Catan", "url": "https://crocodice.net/products/game-of-thrones-catan", "description": "Take the Black!

Players can fight as long as they want, but if they die in combat, they lose their progress. Players can opt out of fighting to bank their blood and save it permanently.
